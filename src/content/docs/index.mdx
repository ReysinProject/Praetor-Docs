## Why Praetor?

Praetor is a TypeScript-first permission management library that helps you implement complex authorization logic with ease. Define policies and rules to control access between different objects in your application, all with full type safety.

<CardGrid stagger>
    <Card title="Type-Safe Policies" icon="codePen">
        Define your permission policies with TypeScript's type system, catching potential issues at compile time rather than runtime.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Flexible Rules" icon="puzzle">
        Create complex permission rules by combining conditions, roles, and attributes. Rules can be as simple or sophisticated as your needs require.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Easy Integration" icon="seti:puppet">
        Seamlessly integrate with any TypeScript project. Works with popular frameworks like Express, NestJS, and more.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Performance First" icon="rocket">
        Optimized evaluation of permission rules with minimal overhead, perfect for high-performance applications.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { Client, Policy } from 'praetor';

const client = new Client();
const RessourcePolicy = new Policy<User, Resource>('resource');

RessourcePolicy.rule('edit', (actor, resource) => {
    return actor === resource.owner || actor.role === 'admin';
});

client.register('resource', RessourcePolicy);

const user1 = new User(1, 'user');
const resource1 = new Resource(1, user1);

if (client.allows('resource', 'edit', user1, resource1)) {
    console.log('User is allowed to edit the resource.');
} else {
    console.log('User is not allowed to edit the resource.');
}
```
